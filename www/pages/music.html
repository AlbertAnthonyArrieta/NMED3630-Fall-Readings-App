                    Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
                    So let's pretend a little longer
                    'Cause when we're gone
                    Everything goes on
                    Well, you were staring at the window
                    And I said, "I wanna take you to the sea"
                    And when I'm better, we'll do everything
                    I gotta stop making promises I can't keep
                    But if I was gone tomorrow, won't the waves crash on?
                    Is it selfish that I'm happy as we pass the setting sun?
                    Someday I'll be overcast, but you won't have to cry
                    'Cause we'll do the grieving while I'm by your side
                    I said
                    Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
                    Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
                    So let's pretend a little longer
                    'Cause when we're gone
                    Everything goes on
                    And I'm so scared of getting used to this
                    All the vines that keep you tethered in your room
                    Someday both of us are leaving here
                    But for now, I'll just bring to the sea to you, ooh
                    When you meet me in the daylight like we did before
                    Then I felt you on my shoulder, and you weren't suffering anymore
                    You said, "I'm sorry that you worry, but don't apologize"
                    I told you to forget me, but you stayed by my side
                    When I said
                    Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
                    Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
                    So let's pretend a little longer
                    And when we're gone, ah
